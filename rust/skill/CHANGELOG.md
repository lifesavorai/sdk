# Changelog — lifesavor-skill-sdk

All notable changes to this crate will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0] - Unreleased

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: `lifesavor-skill-sdk` now depends on `lifesavor-agent-types` instead of the full `lifesavor-agent` crate (for default features)
- **BREAKING**: `SystemComponentType::VectorStore` renamed to `MemoryStore` in re-exported types
- **BREAKING**: `ProviderType::VectorStore` renamed to `MemoryStore` in re-exported types
- No mandatory `tokio` dependency for synchronous skills — async runtime only required with `agent-runtime` feature
- Reduced transitive dependency count (target < 50 crates without dev-dependencies)

### Added

- Re-exports of `ComponentDeclaration`, `ToolSchema` from `lifesavor-agent-types`
- Re-exports of `BridgeRequest`, `BridgeResponse`, `SandboxConfig`, `SkillManifest` from `lifesavor-agent-types`
- **`upgrade_builder` module** — Fluent builders for the `[upgrade]` manifest section:
  - `UpgradeSectionBuilder` — declare min agent version, breaking changes, health checks, lifecycle hooks, migration scripts, data preservation
  - `AdapterDependencyBuilder` — declare fine-tuned adapter dependencies with base model requirements and version constraints
  - `MigrationBuilder` — sub-builder for glob-based migration rules
- **Re-exports from `lifesavor-agent-types::upgrade_manifest`:**
  - `UpgradeSection`, `UpgradeHealthCheck`, `UpgradeHookPaths`, `MigrationEntry`
  - `AdapterDependencyDeclaration`
  - `validate_upgrade_section()`, `validate_adapter_dependency()`
- Prelude now includes all upgrade types and builders
- Component manifest template includes commented `[upgrade]` and `[[adapter_dependencies]]` sections

### Notes

- Path dependencies must be replaced with version dependencies before publishing to crates.io
- The `agent-runtime` feature and `lifesavor-agent` dependency are monorepo-only and excluded from crates.io publishing
- See `../PUBLISHING.md` for the full publishing workflow
- Publish `lifesavor-agent-types` first, then this crate
